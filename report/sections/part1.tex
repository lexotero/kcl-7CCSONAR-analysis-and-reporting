\section{Part 1 - Data and Analysis Methodologies}

\subsection{Source of Data}

For our research, we selected a dataset containing 1000 records of patients from a multispecialty hospital in India.
Each record contains the patient ID, age and gender, and 12 other features representing the common observations and
information taken for patients presenting heart disease symptoms. All records are annotated showing whether the patient
suffers or not from a heart disease. Table \ref{description-of-features} shows a detail description of all the features
in the dataset.

The dataset is publicly available in Kaggle. \href{https://www.kaggle.com/}{Kaggle} is the largest online platform for data scientists, providing both
tools and data for scientific analysis, as well as hosting competitions. It is currently the biggest and
most active online scientific community, with over 15 million users \cite{Kaggle}.

\subsection{Limitations}

We chose this dataset as it contained common features used in research for cardiovascular disease prediction \cite{STSegmentChanges}
\cite{STSlopePredictor} \cite{STSlopePredictorComparison}. Nonetheless, we recognise that there is not much information available
about the dataset and how it was collected. The author has good reputation in Kaggle, but without a proper trace for the origin of
the records, we should be sceptical about the results, particularly about the chosen prediction model.
We mitigate this limitation by applying our prediction model to a well documented dataset, the heart disease dataset maintained by
UC Irvine \cite{HeartDiseaseDataset}.

\subsection{Research Objectives and Analysis Methodologies}

In this section, we introduce the research objectives and the selected analysis methodologies applied to the dataset
to meant these objectives.

This research has a main objective and three "sub-objectives" that help us understand the data we are working with
and expand our knowledge of the field.

\subsubsection{Main Objective: Generate a prediction model}

The main objective of this report is to generate a prediction model that can accurately label patients with heart disease
for a set of values for the given features. Having this prediction model would allow medical professionals to automatically
diagnose patients even helping prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases thanks to early diagnosis.

To generate a prediction model, we will try different well-known classification algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbour, 
Decision Trees, and Random Forest. For each of the evaluated algorithms, we will train the model using the dataset and
generate accuracy markers for the resulting predictions.

Once we have identified a classification algorithm that yields good predictions (we set the threshold at >95\%), we can
use it to generate a prediction for different dataset, thus verifying its accuracy and ensuring that we are not over-fitting.

\subsubsection{Sub-objective 1: Understand demographic distribution}

One of the first analysis we must carry out against the dataset is a demographic analysis. We want to understand
the demographic distribution so that we can identify potential biases (e.g. age bias and gender bias).

It is well known that, in the past, medical studies had a high incidence of gender bias, particularly in cardiovascular
research \cite{GenderBiasCardiovascularResearch}.

\subsubsection{Sub-objective 2: Identify potential predictors in categorical data}

\subsubsection{Sub-objective 3: Identify potential predictors in numerical data}
