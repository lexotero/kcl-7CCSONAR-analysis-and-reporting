\section{Introduction}
The present document contains a report of the analysis carried out on a Cardiovascular Disease dataset
\cite{Dataset}. The purpose of the analysis is to gain an understanding of the
different features that may help predict the presence of a heart condition and produce a prediction model
that could be used to provide early detection or at least automatic diagnosis based on present indicators.

The dataset selected contains 1000 patient records with 12 features common to other cardiovascular disease datasets.

This report is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the origin, characteristics and limitations of the dataset,
presents the research objectives and the analysis methodologies used to achieve them. The second part contains the in-depth
analysis of the data, including patient demographics, measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and data correlation.
The third part explores different prediction models and their accuracy, using an additional dataset to evaluate the results.
Finally, the fourth part presents a summary of all the findings and conclusions.

Note that all the code to generate charts and metrics is available through the links listed in the appendix.
